Overview- 
The MedCare Expert System is a basic expert system designed to assist with diagnosing potential medical conditions based on provided symptoms. It offers a simple interface for inputting symptoms and receiving possible conditions along with general advice. This system is a static example and serves educational purposes, illustrating fundamental concepts in expert systems.

Features- 
Symptom Analysis: Matches user-provided symptoms to a predefined list of conditions.
Condition-Based Advice: Provides general advice for each identified condition.

Input- 
user_symptoms: A comma-separated string of symptoms provided by the user.

Output- 
Possible conditions: List of conditions that match any of the provided symptoms.
Advice: Basic advice for each identified condition.

Note- 
This is a simplified model and should not be used for actual medical diagnosis. Real-world systems would require a more sophisticated approach, including a comprehensive knowledge base, advanced inference algorithms, a user-friendly interface, and integration with real medical data.
